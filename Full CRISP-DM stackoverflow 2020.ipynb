    "#### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is required to run the code. The basic packages that come woth the Anaconda distribution are sufficient for this project. All python files are created and run in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "From this dataset, I set out to answer 3 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Can someone be too old to learn coding?\n",
    "    2. What are some factors that contribute to starting late to code?\n",
    "    3. What are some common effects of people who started coding late (from 30 years old)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File description\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a summary of the entire workflow to understand, clean and analyse the data in order to answer the questions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used here are both available within the folder. These datasets are 'survey_results_public.csv' (from stackoverflow website) and 'countries regions2.csv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of [this github repository](https://github.com/suemnjeri/stackoverflow2020), other notebooks (part 1 to part 4) are available that are more detailed in analysis and cleaning, as noted in the repository's readme file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results and visualizations are well documented in [this medium post.](https://towardsdatascience.com/this-data-answers-the-am-i-too-old-to-learn-coding-timeless-question-70deba5d294f)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was made possible because of the data provided by stackoverflow. Find the the 2020 dataset along with those from other years [here.](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)"
